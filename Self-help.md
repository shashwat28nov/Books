# Self Help Books:

A self-help book is one that is written with the intention to instruct its readers on solving personal problems.
The books take their name from Self-Help, an 1859 best-seller by Samuel Smiles, but are also known and classified under "self-improvement", a term that is a modernized version of self-help.
